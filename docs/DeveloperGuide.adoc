== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Task Object

The Task object stores information related to a single deadline or task, in a manner similar to how Person information is stored. +
As such, it also shares the same types of commands as the Person object, namely the add, delete, list, select, and edit commands.
Instead of making a new Logic object for each new command, polymorphism is used to implement the "Task" version of each command.

An example of using polymorphism to handle Person vs Task addition:

[source,java]
----
public class AddCommand extends Command {
    public AddCommand(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        toAdd = new Person(person);
        toHandle = HANDLE_TYPE_PERSON;
    }

    public AddCommand(ReadOnlyTask task) {
        toAdd = new Task(task);
        toHandle = HANDLE_TYPE_TASK;
    }
}
----

The AddCommand will thus call a different constructor depending on the type of the argument supplied to it. To facilitate this, the respective Parser class must also be modified:

[source,java]
----
public AddCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    int objectType = checkType(args);

    if (objectType == HANDLE_TYPE_PERSON) {
        Person toAdd = createNewPerson(args);
    } else if (objectType == HANDLE_TYPE_TASK) {
        Task toAdd = createNewTask(args);
    }
    return new AddCommand(toAdd);
}
----

The AddCommandParser checks the args to see if this is a task, then creates the object to be added, and creates a new AddCommand to handle the result. +
The sequence diagram below shows how this is done:

image::AddTaskSeq.png[width="800"]

To support the addition of Task objects, the Storage component is modified to accept Task objects in a similar manner as to how Person objects are being stored.

[source, html]
---
    <persons>
        <name>someone else</name>
        <phone></phone>
        <email></email>
        <address></address>
    </persons>
    <tasks>
        <name>Buy new pencil</name>
        <description>Buy new pencil for writing purposes</description>
        <deadline></deadline>
        <priority>2</priority>
    </tasks>
---

Tasks objects are stored in the same level of hierarchy as Person objects, and during startup, are read and entered into the UniqueTaskList, which handles all the tasks that are present in the address book.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of Task-related commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use polymorphism to allow existing commands to implement the new commands +
**Pros:** Under this scheme, any command can be extended to allow addition of new commands of any type, without affecting the architecture significantly +
**Cons:** SRP may be violated as each Command class may now need to handle 2 different types of objects. +
**Alternative 2:** Create new classes for all new commands +
**Pros:** Simpler to implement. +
**Cons:** Code duplication occurs as the commands for Person and Tasks objects share the same structure.

---

**Aspect:** Storage of Task objects +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store Tasks objects in a separate XML file +
**Pros:** Easier to manage as Person storage will not interfere with Task storage, and vice versa.
**Cons:** All existing save/load functions will require an additional method to handle Task storage.
**Alternative 2:** Store Task objects together in the default XML storage file +
**Pros** Only 1 storage file is needed. The storage manager thus only needs to refer to one storage +
**Cons** Any changes to the Person or Task will affect the storage of both the Person and Task objects. This will increase coupling between the Person and Task classes.

=== Sort Command

The sort command is facilitated by the `sortBy` method in UniquePersonList. It supports
sort by ascending or by descending order in any field.

The sort enhancement utilises the Java Collections Sort API by passing it a custom Comparator.

The sort command is parsed through `SortCommandParser`, which passes control over to the `SortCommand`
class. The actual sorting happens via the UniquePersonList class.

The Logic Diagram for this sort command implementation is shown below:

image::SortCommandDiagram.png[width="800"]

Suppose a user enters a new command `sort name desc`. The following sequence diagram
demonstrates how the sort command works.

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800]

Note that the execution of the sort methods result in the actual person list being sorted.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `sort Command` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement sorting functionality in `UniquePersonList` class. +
**Pros:** Delegates the concern of sorting to the class that is responsible for the core of most operations done to the person lists. Future changes to the implementation will be easier as a consequence. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the flow of control passed between classes at first. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement the sorting functionality within other classes like `AddressBook` or `SortCommand`. +
**Pros:** May be more intuitive for new developers and it is easier to trace function calls between lesser classes involved. +
**Cons:** Violates Separation of Concern principle and causes unnecessary content coupling whereby the `UniquePersonList` will have to rely on the `SortCommand` class.

---

**Aspect:** Temporary Sort Implementation vs. Persistent Sort Implementation +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book after sorting. +
**Pros:** More intuitive for both user and developer and reduced complexity in implementation. +
**Cons:** Old order of contact instances in the address book will be lost +
**Alternative 2:** Duplicate a temporary version of the list and sort it for viewing (i.e. the actual list is not sorted) +
**Pros:** Old order of contact instances remains intact. +
**Cons:** Will use more memory and may be less intuitive for developer to understand and in terms of user experience. Also, sorting will not persist in the system.

=== Backup Command

The backup command makes use of both the model manager and the storage manager. The `LogicManager` class was
improved to support the accessing of storage value.

The backup command arguments are parsed through the `BackupCommandParser`, which passes control over to the
`BackupCommand` class. If there is a file path specified by the user, then the `execute()` command within the
`BackupCommand` class will save the backup file to that path. If not file path is specified, the backup file will be
saved to a default location.

Suppose a user enters a new command `backup`. The backup file will be saved to a default location:

image::BackupSequenceDefaultDiagram.png[width="800"]

Suppose a user enters a new command `backup testBackup.xml`. The following sequence diagram
demonstrates how this works:

image::BackupSequenceCustomDiagram.png[width="800]

Note that the execution of the sort methods result in the actual person list being sorted.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `backup Command` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement backup command via Command Line Interface +
**Pros:** Backing up data is easier and faster for users who are familiar with the commands. Less button clicks. +
**Cons:** UI not as intuitive. Users who are not familiar with the application may not know about this feature +
**Alternative 2:** Implement backup command via GUI +
**Pros:** More intuitive for all users since the options are all graphical +
**Cons:** Hinders productivity. Excessive number of clicks to accomplish an essential task.

---

**Aspect:** Custom and/or Default file paths for backup file +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implemented both types of commands +
**Pros:** User can choose either command option. Gives the user more choices +
**Cons:** May seem confusing to the user at first +
**Alternative 2:** Implement only the default option (save backup file to data directory of application) +
**Pros:** Faster for the user to key in one word rather than a command with many words +
**Cons:** Reduces choice for experienced users who may want to save to another location or use a different save name

=== Privacy of fields

The `Name`, `Phone`, `Email` and `Address` of a `Person` contains a boolean `isPrivate`, which will determine if the field belonging to that person is private or not.

Adding a person with private fields uses the same `AddCommand` as adding a person with no public fields. +
To determine if the field that is added should be set to private, a `p` is added to the start of the prefix. +
Hence, `pe/[EMAIL]` will set that person's email to be private, whereas if `e/[EMAIL]` was used, that person's email would be public. +

These new prefixes can be found in `CliSyntax`, and `AddCommandParser` will take data with these prefixes.
`AddCommandParser` will then call the appropriate method in `ParserUtil`, which will parse the string provided into a new field.
Depending on whether or not the field is supposed to be private, `ParsetUtil` will call the appropriate constructor.
Upon obtaining all the fields anc creating a new `Person`, `AddCommandParser` will create a new `AddCommand` to handle the addition of the new `Person`.

This is illustrated by the following sequence diagram:

image::AddPrivateSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `isPrivate` boolean is private, however, the value can be obtained using the following getter method:
[source,java]
----
public boolean isPrivate() {
    return isPrivate;
}
----

To change the `isPrivate` value, the following setter method is used:
[source,java]
----
public void setPrivate(boolean isPrivate) {
    this.isPrivate = isPrivate;
}
----

If a field is private, then the `toString` method will return a string `<Private [FIELD]>`, where `[FIELD]` is the name of that field. +
This can be seen from the `toString` method in `Name`:
[source,java]
----
@Override
public String toString() {
    if (isPrivate) {
        return "<Private Name>";
    }
    return fullName;
}
----

Since the information displayed in a person's card in the UI gets the value of the field through the `toString()` method, this hides the actual value of the field in the UI.

In addition, if `isPrivate` is `true` for `Name`, clicking on a person's card in the UI will not trigger a search on Google for that person's name.

Instead, a `NewResultAvailableEvent` will be raised by `BrowserPanel` to inform the user that they are not allowed to search for a person possessing a private `Name`.

To keep track of whether each field is private or not, `XmlAdaptedPerson` will have to store the `isPrivate` value for each field of `Person`.
This is done by adding the following

[source,java]
----
@XmlElement(required = true)
   private Boolean nameIsPrivate;
@XmlElement(required = true)
   private Boolean phoneIsPrivate;
@XmlElement(required = true)
   private Boolean emailIsPrivate;
@XmlElement(required = true)
   private Boolean addressIsPrivate;
----
Which results in a `Person` being saved in the xml file in the following format

[source, html]
----
<persons>
    <name>Alex Yeoh</name>
    <nameIsPrivate>false</nameIsPrivate>
    <phone>87438807</phone>
    <phoneIsPrivate>false</phoneIsPrivate>
    <email>alexyeoh@example.com</email>
    <emailIsPrivate>false</emailIsPrivate>
    <address>Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40</address>
    <addressIsPrivate>false</addressIsPrivate>
    <tagged>friends</tagged>
</persons>
----

If an old save file without privacy data is loaded, then the `toModelType()` method in `XmlAdaptedPerson` will set `isPrivate` to be `false` for each field of `Person`, to keep the displayed information the same.

[NOTE]
If a private field is to be edited by `EditCommand`, `createEditedPerson()` in `EditCommand` will not modify the data of that field, even though `EditCommand` will create a new `CommandResult` with a success message. +
Hence, a private field will remain private and the value stored by that field will remain the same as it originally was.

This is done through the `createEditedPerson` method in `EditCommand`.
`createEditedPerson` sets the boolean `areFieldsAllPrivate` to initially be true.

As the new instance of each field is being generated, if any field contains a value in the input `EditPersonDescriptor` and that field was not originally private, `areFieldsAllPrivate` is set to false.

This can be seen from the following code, which is used for the generation of a new `Name` object.
[source,java]
----
private static Name createUpdatedName(ReadOnlyPerson personToEdit, EditPersonDescriptor editPersonDescriptor) {
        Name updatedName;
        if (!personToEdit.getName().isPrivate()) {
            updatedName = editPersonDescriptor.getName().orElse(personToEdit.getName());
            if (editPersonDescriptor.getName().isPresent()) {
                areFieldsAllPrivate = false;
            }
        } else {
            updatedName = personToEdit.getName();
        }
        return updatedName;
    }
----

Upon generation of all the fields, if `areFieldsAllPrivate` is still true, `createEditedPerson` will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`, which will cause `EditCommand` to throw a `CommandException` and prevent the command from continuing.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `isPrivate` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a boolean to each field class. +
**Pros:** Similar implementation to how the fields are currently being implemented. Privacy settings can be obtained directly from the field class itself. +
**Cons:** Repetitive code. Additional overloaded constructor and methods are needed to set and get the value of `isPrivate`.  +
**Alternative 2:** Store a person's privacy settings outside of the field classes in an Array or a HashMap in `Person`. +
**Pros:** Can access and modify the privacy settings of all fields easily. +
**Cons:** The fields themselves do not have any indication of whether or not they are private, and will have to check with the `Person` the belong to.

---
**Aspect:** How to determine if a field for a newly added person should be private. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a `p` to the start of each field's prefix to signify that that field should be private. +
**Pros:** Can add `Person` containing any combination of private and public fields in 1 command line. +
**Cons:** Have to modify `AddCommand`, `AddCommandParser`, `ParserUtil` and other classes to detect the new prefix and call a separate constructor when a field is private. +
**Alternative 2:** A `Person` is added with all field public, a separate command will then have to be used to set the desired fields to be private. +
**Pros:** Easier implementation, do not have to modify `AddCommand`. +
**Cons:** Requires 2 command lines to create a `Person` with private fields, which takes more time and is more inconvenient for users.

=== Changing of a Person's Privacy

`ChangePrivacyCommand` facilitates the setting of an existing person's field's privacy. Depending on the user's input, `ChangePrivacyCommand` will use each field's `setPrivate()` method to set the value of `isPrivate`.

The sequence diagram for `ChangePrivacyCommand` is illustrated below.

image::ChangePrivacySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Upon receiving a String containing the arguments from `AddressBookParser`, `ChangePrivacyCommandParser` will create a `PersonPrivacySettings` object.

Depending on the input, the `ChangePrivacyCommandParser` will set the privacy values, represented by Booleans, in the `PersonPrivacySettings` object to be `true` or `false`.

`ChangePrivacyCommandParser` will then create a new `ChangePrivacyCommand` using the input `Index` and the `PersonPrivacySettings`

When `ChangePrivacyCommand` starts executing, it will create a new `Person` based on the data of the `Person` at the specified `Index`.
It will then adjust the privacy values based on the input `PersonPrivacySettings`.

Once it is done, it will update the original `Person` with the newly created `Person` in `Model`.

[NOTE]
If there are missing fields in the input string, the getter methods in `PersonPrivacySettings` will return `false`, but the actual value stored will remain as `null`.
This allows `isAnyFieldNonNull` to check if the user has input any field at all.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to implement changing of a person's privacy. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate command to do so. +
**Pros:** It is clear to users and developers that `changeprivacy` is to modify a person's privacy while `edit` changes the actual data if the relevant field is not private.  +
**Cons:** Additional command, parser and tests must be created.  +
**Alternative 2:** Enhance the functionality of EditCommand. +
**Pros:** Can make use of existing code to aid the implementation. +
**Cons:** Increases the complexity of EditCommand for both users and developers. More ambiguous as to how editing a private field will affect the data.

=== Locating a Person on Google Maps

Upon calling the `locate` command, `LocateCommandParser` will parse the input string into an `Index`, and create a new `LocateCommand`. Should the arguments be a non-integer, a `ParseException` will be thrown. +
This can be seen from the code snippet below:

[source, java]
----
 public LocateCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        try {
            Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
            return new LocateCommand(index);
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(
                    String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, LocateCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }
----

Upon execution of `LocateCommand`, it will search the `Model` for the `Person` at the input `Index`. If the `Index` is out of range of the list of `Person`s, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

Otherwise, `LocateCommand` will post a new `BrowserPanelLocateEvent` and pass in the `Person` found to that event. It will then return a `CommandResult` indicating the success of its execution.

This code for this can be found below:

[source, java]
----
@Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new BrowserPanelLocateEvent(
                model.getFilteredPersonList().get(targetIndex.getZeroBased())));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_LOCATE_PERSON_SUCCESS, targetIndex.getOneBased()));

    }
----

BrowserPanel will then use `handleBrowserPanelLocationEvent` to process this newly created event. It will call `loadMapsPage`, which will check if the `Person`'s `Address` is private or not. If their `Address` is public, it will launch the browser, showing the `Address` of that `Person` on Google Maps. Otherwise, an error message will be printed, as can be seen below:

[source, java]
----
 private void loadMapsPage(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        if (person.getAddress().isPrivate()) {
            raise(new NewResultAvailableEvent(PRIVATE_ADDRESS_CANNOT_SEARCH));
        } else {
            loadPage(GOOGLE_MAPS_URL_PREFIX + person.getAddress().toString().replaceAll(" ", "+")
                + GOOGLE_MAPS_URL_SUFFIX);
        }
    }
----

The overall sequence of events is illustrated by the following sequence diagram:

image::LocateSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of the Google Maps to search for a person's `Address` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a seperate command `locate`. +
**Pros:** No modification needed for existing commands, which makes it clear the purpose of each command. +
**Cons:** Additional commands will need to be learnt for both developers and users. +
**Alternative 2:** Add the functionality into `SelectCommand`. +
**Pros:** Expands the utility of `SelectCommand` beyond performing a Google search on their name. +
**Cons:** Will require significant modification of existing code, and may make it more confusing for users.

=== Add/Delete Tag mechanism

The add/delete tag mechanism is facilitated by `personArrayList`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports add/delete
tag for all persons in the address book. This command will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

The add/delete tag command are executed by `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` are parsed through `AddTagCommandParser` and `DeleteTagCommandParser`.
It is different from `edit [INDEX] [TAG]` since it allows the user to perform the addition and deletion of tags for multiple people at once.
If the user wants to add the `t/friends` tag for the first 3 persons in the address book, the `AddTagCommand` (`addtag 1 2 3 t/friends`) will be executed.
The same operation will happen for `deletetag` command.

The `AddTagCommand` goes through all the persons in the address book and add tag to the persons with specific index. The `DeleteTagCommand` works
in a similar way.

The example of how `AddTagCommand` is working:
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Adds a tag to the persons in the list from the address book.
 */
public class AddTagCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    /**
         * Check whether the index within the range then checks whether the specific persons have the tag.
         * If not, add the tag to the person that doesn't have the given tag.
         */
        @Override
        public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {

            for (Index targetIndex : targetIndexes) {
                // check whether the index within the range
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < targetIndexes.size(); i++) {
                // check whether all persons have the given tag
            }
            // throw exception for duplicated tag
            return new CommandResult();
        }
----

Suppose the user enter the `addtag 1 2 t/friends` command. The following sequence diagram shows how the add tag command works:

image::AddTagSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

The `deletetag` command works the same as `addtag` command with different name only.

[NOTE]
If the input index does not exist, the `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` will throw an exception.

If the tag to be deleted does not exist, the `DeleteTagCommand` will throw an exception.

If the tag to be added exists in every target person in the address book, the `AddTagCommand` will throw an exception.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of the `addtag` and `deletetag` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** implement the methods in `ModelManager` +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. `ModelManager` includes all the methods and variables. +
**Cons:** Must modify `Model` also to fit the `ModelManager`. Beginner may have difficulty to understand the different functions in Model component+
**Alternative 2:** Implement the `addtag` and `deletetag` in `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` respectively. +
**Pros:** Easier to understand. +
**Cons:** Repetitive code. Additional overload constructor needs to be implement. The `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` will have to update the person list.
This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

---
**Aspect:** Implementation of the `AddTagCommend` and `DeleteTagCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** create new command `addtag` and `deletetag` +
**Pros:** Less modification of existing command and parser +
**Cons:** Users have to learn how to use the additional commands +
**Alternative 2:** Modify the existing `add` and `delete` command +
**Pros:** Users could use the same commands to achieve different purpose +
**Cons:** Additional override the constructor for the existing command. It might not be easy for the beginner.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.

==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
