By: `Team W09-B2`      Since: `August 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up Address++ in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103AUG2017-W09-B2/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103AUG2017-W09-B2/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::fontsize[]
=== Increase/Decrease/Reset Font Size

On some screens, the text appear to be too small. The aim of the increase/decrease/reset font size feature is to allow
users to customize the application's font size quickly on the go.

image::FontSizeUI.png[width="540"]

There are two methods of calling changes in font size:

1. `onAction` handlers are used to handle UI font size buttons. These handlers will post
new events via `ComponentManager`.

2. CLI commands also post new events to handle font size changes, when the relevant command is entered (e.g. `fontsize increase`).

image::FontSizeChangeSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]
From the sequence diagram above, we can observe that the font size changes are handled by subscriber functions in PersonListPanel
and TaskListPanel.

[NOTE]
The initial implementation required access to the model from the UI. This implementation was replaced with one that
standardised the handling of font size change requests through events.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Use either UI or CLI based implementations +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implementing both UI and CLI functionality +
**Pros:** More options for the user. The was also not much increase in complexity when implementing the CLI version  +
**Cons:** This implementation required passing information between classes, which may cause unnecessary coupling. +

**Alternative 2:** Implementing only UI functionality +
**Pros:** Less tedious to implement and very intuitive for the user +
**Cons:** Users who prefer typing commands will not have the option of editing their font sizes using the CLI
//end::fontsize[]

//tag::avatar[]
=== Setting Avatar on ViewPersonPanel

The following function allows the setting of URL for the `ImageView` attribute within the `ViewPersonPanel` class:
[source,java]
----
private void initializeAvatar() {
        try {
            String avatarPath = person.getAvatar().value;
            if (!avatarPath.equals("")) {
                logger.info("Initializing avatar to image at saved URL");
                Image newImage = new Image(avatarPath);
                avatarImage.setImage(newImage);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
----

The `initializeAvatar` method piggybacks on the `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` event handler. Whenever there is
a change in the person selection panel, this function will call the `initializeAvatar` method, which will update
the `ImageView` attribute.
[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
    private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        this.person = event.getNewSelection().person;
        initializeWithPerson(person);
        initializeAvatar();
    }
----

[NOTE]
As of v1.5rc, the avatar field supports only URLs sourced online. References to local files may not work at the moment.
//end::avatar[]

//tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +

**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +

**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +

**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +

**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::task[]
=== Task Object

The Task object stores information related to a single deadline or task, in a manner similar to how Person information is stored. +
As such, it also shares the same types of commands as the Person object, namely the `add`, `delete`, `find`, `select`, and `edit` commands.
Object inheritance is thus used to create the commands that are shared with those used to handle Person objects.

==== Task-related Command implementation

An example of using inheritance to handle Person vs Task addition:

[source,java]
----
public class AddPersonCommand extends AddCommand {
}

public class AddTaskCommand extends AddCommand {
}
----

[source,java]
----
public AddCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    int objectType = checkType(args);

    if (objectType == HANDLE_TYPE_PERSON) {
        Person toAdd = createNewPerson(args);
        return AddPersonCommand(toAdd);
    } else if (objectType == HANDLE_TYPE_TASK) {
        Task toAdd = createNewTask(args);
        return AddTaskCommand(toAdd);
    }
}
----

The Parser in charge of the command will thus return either an AddPersonCommand, or an AddTaskCommand, depending on whether you specify to add a Task or not in the arguments.
 +
The sequence diagram below shows how this is done:

image::AddTaskSeq.png[width="800"]

==== Task Object Storage

[source, xml]
---
    <persons>
        <name>someone else</name>
        <phone></phone>
        <email></email>
        <address></address>
    </persons>
    <tasks>
        <name>Buy new pencil</name>
        <description>Buy new pencil for writing purposes</description>
        <deadline></deadline>
        <priority>2</priority>
    </tasks>
---

Task objects are stored in a similar manner to Person objects, and share the same level of hierarchy as Person objects. During startup, tasks are read and entered into the UniqueTaskList, which handles all the tasks that are present in the address book.


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of Task-related commands +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use inheritance to implement different commands for Task and Person objects +
**Pros:** Can be easily extended to allow handling of other types of objects, and preserves Separation of Concerns. +
**Cons:** Minor code duplication occurs as the commands for Person and Tasks objects share the same structure. +

**Alternative 2:** Use polymorphism to allow existing commands to implement task handling +
**Pros:** Code duplication is kept to a minimum as the Command will handle Task and Person objects in the same class. +
**Cons:** Single Responsibility Principle is violated as each Command class now needs to handle 2 different types of objects. +

---

**Aspect:** Storage of Task objects +

**Alternative 2:** Store Task objects together in the default XML storage file +
**Pros** Only 1 storage file is needed. The storage manager thus only needs to refer to one storage +
**Cons** Any changes to the Person or Task will affect the storage of both the Person and Task objects. This will increase coupling between the Person and Task classes. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store Tasks objects in a separate XML file +
**Pros:** Easier to manage as Person storage will not interfere with Task storage, and vice versa. +
**Cons:** All existing save/load functions will require an additional method to handle Task storage. +
// end::task[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Command

The sort command is facilitated by the `sortBy` methods in UniquePersonList and UniqueTaskList. It supports
sort by ascending or by descending order in any field.

The sort enhancement utilises the Java Collections Sort API by passing it a custom Comparator.

The sort command is parsed through `SortCommandParser`, which passes control over to the `SortCommand`
class. The actual sorting happens via the UniquePersonList class or the UniqueTaskList class.

The UML Class diagram for sort commands that trigger sorting in person listings is shown below:

image::SortCommandPersonDiagram.png[width="800"]

Likewise, the UML Class diagram for sort commands that trigger sorting in person listings is shown below:

image::SortCommandTaskDiagram.png[width="800"]

We can deduce from the UML diagrams diagrams above that the only difference between the implementation
of the sorting for persons and tasks lies in the location where the sorting is actually executed.

Suppose a user enters a new command `sort name desc`. The following sequence diagram
demonstrates how the sort command works.

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800]

Note that the execution of the sort methods result in the actual person or task list being sorted. The resulting list
is not returned, but will be reflected in the application's storage and graphical user interface.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `sort Command` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement sorting functionality in `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTaskList` class. +
**Pros:** Delegates the concern of sorting to the class that is responsible for the core of most operations done to the lists.
Future changes to the implementation will be easier as a consequence. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the flow of control passed between classes at first. +

**Alternative 2:** Implement the sorting functionality within other classes like `AddressBook` or `SortCommand`. +
**Pros:** May be more intuitive for new developers and it is easier to trace function calls between lesser classes involved. +
**Cons:** Violates Separation of Concern principle and causes unnecessary content coupling whereby the `UniquePersonList` will have to rely on the `SortCommand` class.

---

**Aspect:** Temporary Sort Implementation vs. Persistent Sort Implementation +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book after sorting. +
**Pros:** More intuitive and reduces complexity in implementation. +
**Cons:** Old order of contact instances in the address book will be lost +

**Alternative 2:** Duplicate a temporary version of the list and sort it for viewing (i.e. the actual list is not sorted) +
**Pros:** Old order of contact instances remains intact. +
**Cons:** Will use more memory and may be less intuitive for developer to understand and in terms of user experience. Also, sorting will not persist in the system.
// end::sort[]

// tag::backup[]
=== Backup Command

The `backup` command uses the event handler `BackupRequestEvent`. When raised, this
event notifies the subscriber `backupAddressBook` method in Storage class.

The outlining sequence diagram for this process (excluding the interaction with the
`BackupRequestEvent`) is shown below:

image::BackupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `backup Command` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an event handler to initialize the backup process +
**Pros:** Avoids coupling the logic to the storage unnecessarily. +
**Cons:** May not be as intuitive for some developers in the beginning +

**Alternative 2:** Access storage component directly instead of using event handlers +
**Pros:** May be more intuitive as it is a direct approach +
**Cons:** Violates the Law of Demeter.
// end::backup[]

// tag::password[]
=== Lock and Unlock Command

The `lock` and `unlock` commands utilise the Model to access the user preferences of
the application.

Like most of the other commands, arguments are parsed through the `UnlockCommandParser` or `LockCommandParser`,
which passes control over to the `UnlockCommand` and `LockCommand` class respectively.
These `Command` classes will then call the Model to toggle the lock's state.

The activity diagram below outlines the basic logic of the lock states concept.:

image::LockStatesActivityDiagram.png[width="800]

From the activity diagram we can see that lock states are preserved in preferences.json
after the application closes by passing the lock state into the `UserPrefs` class to be
saved by the Storage component.

[NOTE]
The default state of the lock is set to False (i.e. locked) when the user first opens the
application. Subsequent changes to the lock will persist in the user preferences.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `lock` and `unlock` Commands

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Call methods in the Model directly to change UserPrefs +
**Pros:** More intuitive. Highest returns for minimal amount of code +
**Cons:** May be confusing to some developers in the beginning, since another
intuitive approach is to use event handlers +

**Alternative 2:** Use Event Handlers +
**Pros:** More intuitive for some developers +
**Cons:** Will still have to access Model, which makes its advantage over direct calls next to none

=== ChangePassword Command
The default password when users first open Address++ is `password`. The ChangePassword command
sets a new password in the temporary User Preferences. When the application is closed, this
information is passed to the Storage Component to be saved into the file `preferences.json`

To illustrate this concept better, let us have a look at the `preferences.json` file:
[source, json]
{
  "guiSettings" : {
    "windowWidth" : 1080.0,
    "windowHeight" : 720.0,
    "windowCoordinates" : {
      "x" : 0,
      "y" : 22
    }
  },
  "addressBookFilePath" : "data/addressbook.xml",
  "addressBookName" : "My Address++",
  "addressBookLockState" : false,
  "addressBookEncryptedPassword" : "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8"
}

As shown in the cope snippet above, the password is stored as one of the entries in the JSON
file.

[NOTE]
SHA256 encryption was used to calculate a hash for the password. This is to delay anyone snooping around the
user's file directories.

**Validation Checks**
****
1. Password Validation -> Is password correct?
2. Password Confirmation -> Does the new password and confirmation password match?
3. Password Uniqueness -> Is the new password different from the old password?

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** On Demand Saving vs. Save On Exit +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save On Exit +
**Pros:** Simplifies process flow as the command class no longer has to access both Model and Storage components +
**Cons:** Any system/application crash may cause change password data to be lost +

**Alternative 2:** On Demand Saving +
**Pros:** Changes may persist even through system and application crashes +
**Cons:** May slow down application, although not significantly. Complicates process flow.

=== Privacy of fields

The `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address` and `Remark` of a `Person` contains a boolean `isPrivate`, which will determine if the field belonging to that person is private or not.

image::PersonClassDiagramPrivacy.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Class diagram for a Person, only Name, Phone, Email, Address and Remark contain an isPrivate boolean to indicate if it is private or not_

Adding a person with private fields uses the same `AddCommand` as adding a person with no public fields. +
To determine if the field that is added should be set to private, a `p` is added to the start of the prefix. +
Hence, `pe/[EMAIL]` will set that person's email to be private, whereas if `e/[EMAIL]` was used, that person's email would be public. +

These new prefixes can be found in `CliSyntax`, and `AddCommandParser` will take data with these prefixes.
`AddCommandParser` will then call the appropriate method in `ParserUtil`, which will parse the string provided into a new field.
Depending on whether or not the field is supposed to be private, `ParsetUtil` will call the appropriate constructor.
Upon obtaining all the fields anc creating a new `Person`, `AddCommandParser` will create a new `AddCommand` to handle the addition of the new `Person`.

image::AddPrivateSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.2 : Sequence Diagram for adding a Person with private fields_

If a field is private, then the `toString` method will return a string `<Private [FIELD]>`, where `[FIELD]` is the name of that field. +
This can be seen from the `toString` method in `Name`:
[source,java]
----
@Override
public String toString() {
    if (isPrivate) {
        return "<Private Name>";
    }
    return fullName;
}
----

Since the information displayed in a person's card in the UI gets the value of the field through the `toString()` method, this hides the actual value of the field in the UI.

In addition, if `isPrivate` is `true` for `Name`, clicking on a person's card in the UI will not trigger a search on Google for that person's name.

Instead, a `NewResultAvailableEvent` will be raised by `BrowserPanel` to inform the user that they are not allowed to search for a person possessing a private `Name`.

To keep track of whether each field is private or not, `XmlAdaptedPerson` will have to store the `isPrivate` value for each field of `Person`.
This is done by adding the following

[source,java]
----
@XmlElement(required = true)
   private Boolean nameIsPrivate;
@XmlElement(required = true)
   private Boolean phoneIsPrivate;
@XmlElement(required = true)
   private Boolean emailIsPrivate;
@XmlElement(required = true)
   private Boolean addressIsPrivate;
@XmlElement(required = true)
   private Boolean remarkIsPrivate;
----
Which results in a `Person` being saved in the xml file in the following format

[source, html]
----
<persons>
    <name>Alex Yeoh</name>
    <nameIsPrivate>false</nameIsPrivate>
    <phone>87438807</phone>
    <phoneIsPrivate>false</phoneIsPrivate>
    <email>alexyeoh@example.com</email>
    <emailIsPrivate>false</emailIsPrivate>
    <address>Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40</address>
    <addressIsPrivate>false</addressIsPrivate>
    <remark>cheerful lad</remark>
    <remarkIsPrivate>false</remarkIsPrivate>
    <tagged>friends</tagged>
</persons>
----

If an old save file without privacy data is loaded, then the `toModelType()` method in `XmlAdaptedPerson` will set `isPrivate` to be `false` for each field of `Person`, to keep the displayed information the same.

[NOTE]
If a private field is to be edited by `EditCommand`, `createEditedPerson()` in `EditCommand` will not modify the data of that field, even though `EditCommand` will create a new `CommandResult` with a success message. +
Hence, a private field will remain private and the value stored by that field will remain the same as it originally was.

This is done through the `createEditedPerson` method in `EditCommand`.
`createEditedPerson` sets the boolean `areFieldsAllPrivate` to initially be true.

As the new instance of each field is being generated, if any field contains a value in the input `EditPersonDescriptor` and that field was not originally private, `areFieldsAllPrivate` is set to false.

This can be seen from the following code, which is used for the generation of a new `Name` object.
[source,java]
----
private static Name createUpdatedName(ReadOnlyPerson personToEdit, EditPersonDescriptor editPersonDescriptor) {
    Name updatedName;
    if (!personToEdit.getName().isPrivate()) {
        updatedName = editPersonDescriptor.getName().orElse(personToEdit.getName());
        if (editPersonDescriptor.getName().isPresent()) {
            areFieldsAllPrivate = false;
        }
    } else {
        updatedName = personToEdit.getName();
    }
    return updatedName;
}
----

Upon generation of all the fields, if `areFieldsAllPrivate` is still true, `createEditedPerson` will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`, which will cause `EditCommand` to throw a `CommandException` and prevent the command from continuing.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `isPrivate` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a boolean to each field class. +
**Pros:** Similar implementation to how the fields are currently being implemented. Privacy settings can be obtained directly from the field class itself. +
**Cons:** Repetitive code. Additional overloaded constructor and methods are needed to set and get the value of `isPrivate`.  +

**Alternative 2:** Store a person's privacy settings outside of the field classes in an Array or a HashMap in `Person`. +
**Pros:** Can access and modify the privacy settings of all fields easily. +
**Cons:** The fields themselves do not have any indication of whether or not they are private, and will have to check with the `Person` the belong to.

---
**Aspect:** How to determine if a field for a newly added person should be private. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a `p` to the start of each field's prefix to signify that that field should be private. +
**Pros:** Can add `Person` containing any combination of private and public fields in 1 command line. +
**Cons:** Have to modify `AddCommand`, `AddCommandParser`, `ParserUtil` and other classes to detect the new prefix and call a separate constructor when a field is private. +

**Alternative 2:** A `Person` is added with all field public, a separate command will then have to be used to set the desired fields to be private. +
**Pros:** Easier implementation, do not have to modify `AddCommand`. +
**Cons:** Requires 2 command lines to create a `Person` with private fields, which takes more time and is more inconvenient for users.

=== Changing of a Person's Privacy

`ChangePrivacyCommand` facilitates the setting of an existing person's field's privacy. Depending on the user's input, `ChangePrivacyCommand` will use each field's `setPrivate()` method to set the value of `isPrivate`.

The sequence diagram for `ChangePrivacyCommand` is illustrated below.

image::ChangePrivacySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Sequence Diagram for changing the privacy of a Person's fields_

Upon receiving a String containing the arguments from `AddressBookParser`, `ChangePrivacyCommandParser` will create a `PersonPrivacySettings` object.

Depending on the input, the `ChangePrivacyCommandParser` will set the privacy values, represented by Booleans, in the `PersonPrivacySettings` object to be `true` or `false`.

`ChangePrivacyCommandParser` will then create a new `ChangePrivacyCommand` using the input `Index` and the `PersonPrivacySettings`

When `ChangePrivacyCommand` starts executing, it will create a new `Person` based on the data of the `Person` at the specified `Index`.
It will then adjust the privacy values based on the input `PersonPrivacySettings`.

Once it is done, it will update the original `Person` with the newly created `Person` in `Model`.

[NOTE]
If there are missing fields in the input string, the getter methods in `PersonPrivacySettings` will return `false`, but the actual value stored will remain as `null`.
This allows `isAnyFieldNonNull` to check if the user has input any field at all.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of changing of a person's privacy. +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate command to do so. +
**Pros:** It is clear to users and developers that `changeprivacy` is to modify a person's privacy while `edit` changes the actual data if the relevant field is not private.  +
**Cons:** Additional command, parser and tests must be created.  +

**Alternative 2:** Enhance the functionality of EditCommand. +
**Pros:** Can make use of existing code to aid the implementation. +
**Cons:** Increases the complexity of EditCommand for both users and developers. More ambiguous as to how editing a private field will affect the data.

=== Changing the address book's privacy level

`PrivacyLevelCommand` allows the user to change the privacy level of Address++, letting users easily reveal data hidden by private fields, or hide persons containing private fields entirely.

The sequence diagram for `PrivacyLevelCommand` is illustrated below.

image::PrivacyLevelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.6.1 : Sequence Diagram for changing the privacy level of the address book_

`PrivacyLevelCommandParser` will accept any integer that is input in the command line, and create a `PrivacyLevelCommand` that stores the integer, which represents the privacy level to switch to.

Upon execution,`PrivacyLevelCommand` will first check if the integer falls within the range of the minimum and maximum privacy level. If it does not, a new `CommandException` is thrown, reminding the user of the valid input levels.

If the integer is within the valid range, `PrivacyLevelCommand` will update the privacy level of `Model`. Following that, it will proceed to update the privacy level of each person.

`Model`, each `Person` and each field that can be set as private all contain a `privacyLevel` variable to indicate the current privacy level. This value should remain the same between all of these objects throughout the operation of Address++.

image::PersonClassDiagramPrivacyLevel.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.6.2 : Class Diagram of Person, which shows which classes contain an integer to indicate the privacy level_

Finally, depending on the privacy level, `PrivacyLevelCommand` will update the call `model.updateFilteredPersonList()` with the appropriate predicate.

This process is illustrated in the code snippet below.

[source, java]
----
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    if (level < MIN_PRIVACY_LEVEL || level > MAX_PRIVACY_LEVEL) {
        throw new CommandException(WRONG_PRIVACY_LEVEL_MESSAGE);
    }
    model.setPrivacyLevel(level);
    for (int i = 0; i < model.getAddressBook().getPersonList().size(); i++) {
        ReadOnlyPerson toReplace = model.getPersonAtIndexFromAddressBook(i);
        Person newPerson = new Person(toReplace);
        newPerson.setPrivacyLevel(level);
        try {
            model.updatePerson(toReplace, newPerson);
        } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON);
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException e) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target person cannot be missing");
        }
    }
    if (level == 3) {
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(new ShowAllPrivacyLevelPredicate());
    } else {
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
    }
    return new CommandResult(String.format(CHANGE_PRIVACY_LEVEL_SUCCESS, Integer.toString(level)));
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storing of the privacy level +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have each relevant class store a privacy level integer. +
**Pros:** Less coupling, less modification of existing code required.  +
**Cons:** Have to modify every relevant object every time `PrivacyLevelCommand` is called. Runs the risk that an object may accidentally not have its privacy level modified to match the other objects if privacy levels are not properly updated. +

**Alternative 2:** Store the privacy level in the model and have any object that needs to check it query from model. +
**Pros:** Only one integer needs to be modified for the privacy level of the entire address book to change, which also eliminates any possibility that privacy level may be different when used by different objects. +
**Cons:** Increases coupling, classes such as Name will need to have a Model object as one of its variables to access Model. Large scale modification of existing code and tests are necessary.
// end::privacy[]

// tag::locate[]
=== Locating a Person on Google Maps

Upon calling the `locate` command, `LocateCommandParser` will parse the input string into an `Index`, and create a new `LocateCommand`. Should the arguments be a non-integer, a `ParseException` will be thrown. +
This can be seen from the code snippet below:

[source, java]
----
 public LocateCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    try {
        Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
        return new LocateCommand(index);
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(
                String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, LocateCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }
}
----

Upon execution of `LocateCommand`, it will search the `Model` for the `Person` at the input `Index`. If the `Index` is out of range of the list of `Person`s, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

Otherwise, `LocateCommand` will post a new `BrowserPanelLocateEvent` and pass in the `Person` found to that event. It will then return a `CommandResult` indicating the success of its execution.

This code for this can be found below:

[source, java]
----
@Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

        List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new BrowserPanelLocateEvent(
                model.getFilteredPersonList().get(targetIndex.getZeroBased())));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_LOCATE_PERSON_SUCCESS, targetIndex.getOneBased()));

    }
----

BrowserPanel will then use `handleBrowserPanelLocationEvent` to process this newly created event. It will call `loadMapsPage`, which will check if the `Person`'s `Address` is private or not. If their `Address` is public, it will launch the browser, showing the `Address` of that `Person` on Google Maps. Otherwise, an error message will be printed, as can be seen below:

[source, java]
----
 private void loadMapsPage(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    if (person.getAddress().isPrivate()) {
        raise(new NewResultAvailableEvent(PRIVATE_ADDRESS_CANNOT_SEARCH));
    } else {
        loadPage(GOOGLE_MAPS_URL_PREFIX + person.getAddress().toString().replaceAll(" ", "+")
            + GOOGLE_MAPS_URL_SUFFIX);
    }
}
----

The overall sequence of events is illustrated by the following sequence diagram:

image::LocateSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.7.1 : Sequence Diagram for Locating a Person's Address_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of the Google Maps to search for a person's `Address` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate command `locate`. +
**Pros:** No modification needed for existing commands, which makes it clear the purpose of each command. +
**Cons:** Additional commands will need to be learnt for both developers and users. +

**Alternative 2:** Add the functionality into `SelectCommand`. +
**Pros:** Expands the utility of `SelectCommand` beyond performing a Google search on their name. +
**Cons:** Will require significant modification of existing code, and may make it more confusing for users.
// end::locate[]

// tag::navigate[]
=== Navigating from one address to another using Google Maps

When the `navigate` command is entered into the command line, `NavigateCommandParse` will first reset its internal `from`, `to`, `fromIndex`, `toIndex` to null. It will then check for the input prefixes and ensure that only one of the prefixes from the group `fp/`, `ft/`, and `fa/`, which we will subsequently call the `from` prefixes are present. It then does the same with the prefixes from the group `tp/`, `tt/` and `ta/`, which we will call the `to` prefixes. +

This is done by invoking the `checkFrom` and `checkTo` methods as can be seen from the code snippet below. For the example `checkFrom`, it takes in 3 booleans on whether or not each prefix is present and checks whether or not there is exactly one kind of `from` prefix. It throws an error if there are no `from` prefixes or more than one type of `from` prefixes.

[source, java]
----
private void checkFrom(ArgumentMultimap argumentMultimap, boolean fromAddress, boolean fromPerson, boolean fromTask)
        throws ParseException {
    if (!(fromAddress || fromPerson || fromTask)) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, NavigateCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    } else if ((fromAddress && (fromPerson || fromTask)) || (fromPerson && fromTask)) {
        // If 2 or more from prefixes are present
        throw new ParseException(NavigateCommand.MESSAGE_MULTIPLE_FROM_ERROR);
    } else {
        try {
            setArgsForNavigateCommand(argumentMultimap, fromAddress, fromPerson, true);
        } catch (IllegalValueException e) {
            throw new ParseException(e.getMessage(), e);
        }
    }
}
----

`checkFrom` calls `setArgsForNavigateCommand`, which sets the variables in the `NavigateCommandParser` to the appropriate values depending on whether the address originates from a person, a task or is a manual input by the user.

[source, java]
----
private void setArgsForNavigateCommand(ArgumentMultimap argumentMultimap, boolean address, boolean person, boolean forFrom) throws IllegalValueException {
    if (address) {
        if (forFrom) {
            from = new Location(ParserUtil.parseLocationFromAddress(
                    argumentMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAVIGATE_FROM_ADDRESS)).get().toString());
        } else {
            to = new Location(ParserUtil.parseLocationFromAddress(
                    argumentMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAVIGATE_TO_ADDRESS)).get().toString());
        }
    } else if (person) {
        if (forFrom) {
            fromIndex = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argumentMultimap
                    .getValue(PREFIX_NAVIGATE_FROM_PERSON).get());
        } else {
            toIndex = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argumentMultimap
                    .getValue(PREFIX_NAVIGATE_TO_PERSON).get());
        }
    } else {
        if (forFrom) {
            fromIndex = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argumentMultimap
                    .getValue(PREFIX_NAVIGATE_FROM_TASK).get());
        } else {
            toIndex = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argumentMultimap
                    .getValue(PREFIX_NAVIGATE_TO_TASK).get());
        }
    }
}
----

Finally, `NavigateCommandParser` will create a new `NavigateCommand` based on the inputs as set by `setArgsForNavigateCommand`.

When `NavigateCommand` is created, it first checks if there are duplicate `from` or `to` addresses that are passed into it and throws an error if that is the case.

[source, java]
----
private void checkDuplicateFromAndToLocation(Location locationFrom, Location locationTo, Index fromIndex, Index toIndex) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    if (locationFrom != null && fromIndex != null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(MESSAGE_MULTIPLE_FROM_ERROR);
    }
    if (locationTo != null && toIndex != null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(MESSAGE_MULTIPLE_TO_ERROR);
    }
}
----

If it passes this check, `NavigateCommand` stores `fromLocation` and `toLocation`, which are the Locations of any manually added address by the user to navigate from and to respectively. It also stores `toIndex` and `fromIndex`, which are the Indexes of the `Person` or `Task` to extract the address from as well as `toIsTask` and `fromIsTask`, which are booleans that indicate whether `toIndex` and `fromIndex` are indexes of Persons or Tasks.

Upon execution of `NavigateCommmand`, it will first check if it has a non-null `fromIndex`, if it does, it will create a new Location based on its `fromIndex` and `fromIsTask` values using the `setLocationByIndex` method. Otherwise, it will set the Location to be the Location in `locationfrom`. This can be seen below:
[source, java]
----
if (fromIndex != null) {
        try {
            from = setLocationByIndex(fromIndex, fromIsTask);
        } catch (IllegalValueException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(MESSAGE_PRIVATE_PERSON_ADDRESS_ERROR);
        }
    } else {
        from = locationFrom;
    }
----

setLocationByIndex throws Exceptions if the target Person or Task does not have a valid Address to extract.

[source, java]
----
if (fromIndex != null) {
        try {
            from = setLocationByIndex(fromIndex, fromIsTask);
        } catch (IllegalValueException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(MESSAGE_PRIVATE_PERSON_ADDRESS_ERROR);
        }
    } else {
        from = locationFrom;
    }
----

`NavigateCommand` does the same for the Address to navigate `To` and posts a new `BrowserPanelNavigateEvent`, passing in the `Location` to navigate `From` and the `Location` to navigate `To`. +
`NavigateCommand` will then create a new `CommandResult` to indicate a successful `Command`.

`BrowserPanel` will then get the information from this `BrowserPanelNavigateEvent`, and load the appropriate Google Maps URL after replacing information such as the Unit Number and extra whitespaces. This has to be done as Google Maps does not function properly with Unit Numbers or spaces in its URL.

[source, java]
----
private void loadDirectionsPage(String fromLocation, String toLocation) {
    loadPage(GOOGLE_MAPS_DIRECTIONS_PREFIX + "&origin="
            + fromLocation.replaceAll("#(\\w+)\\s*", "").replaceAll(" ", "+")
            .replaceAll("-(\\w+)\\s*", "")
            + "&destination="
            + toLocation.replaceAll("#(\\w+)\\s*", "").replaceAll(" ", "+")
            .replaceAll("-(\\w+)\\s*", "")
            + GOOGLE_MAPS_DIRECTIONS_SUFFIX);
}
----
The overall sequence of events is illustrated by the following sequence diagram:

image::NavigateSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.8.1 : Sequence Diagram for Navigating from one Address to another_


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to pass the appropriate information to NavigateCommand +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have a constructor that takes in a large number of arguments so that NavigateCommand can correctly identify what kind of Location to post in BrowserPanelNavigateEvent. +
**Pros:** Only 1 constructor needed. +
**Cons:** Additional methods will be needed to properly identify which Location to use for navigation.  +

**Alternative 2:** Create many constructors to segregate the different possible scenarios that might happen. +
**Pros:** It is clear what information to use to generate the Locations +
**Cons:** Requires large numbers of constructors to be created, easy for mistakes to occur as Constructors all share the same name but different argument types.

**Aspect:** How to transfer information of the address from one class to another +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Wrap the address in a `Location` class before posting the BrowserPanelNavigateEvent. +
**Pros:** Only Locations, which indicates that the address is properly parsed, will be passed for the BrowserPanel to read, reducing the possibility of BrowserPanel reading stray unwanted strings as addresses to navigate to and from. The value stored inside each Location cannot be altered once that Location object has been created. +
**Cons:** A new class has to be created and Strings, Addresses and TaskAddresses will need to be converted to Locations first.  +

**Alternative 2:** Simply pass on a String containing the address from class to class +
**Pros:** Easy to read and transfer information, lower overhead +
**Cons:** It is easier for stray Strings to pollute the information, and the Strings can be unintentionally modified.
// end::navigate[]

// tag::opensaveas[]
=== Opening and Saving of the .xml save file
Both `OpenCommand` and `SaveAsCommand` function in a very similar way.
When `open` or `save` is input by the user, `AddressBookParser` will create a new `OpenCommand` or `SaveAsCommand`.

These two commands will then post a new `OpenRequestEvent` or a new `SaveAsRequestEvent` and return a successful `CommandResult`.

`MainWindow` will have two methods, `HandleOpenRequestEvent` and `HandleSaveAsRequestEvent` that subscribe to the above two events and will call `handleOpen` and `handleSaveAs`.

[source, java]
----
private void handleOpen() throws IOException, DataConversionException {
    // Set extension filter
    FileChooser.ExtensionFilter extFilter = new FileChooser.ExtensionFilter(
            "XML files (*.xml)", "*.xml");
    fileChooser.getExtensionFilters().add(extFilter);

    // Show open file dialog
    File file = fileChooser.showOpenDialog(primaryStage);
    if (file != null) {
        // Change file path to the opened file
        storage.changeFilePath(file.getPath(), prefs);
        // Reset data in the model to the data from the opened file
        model.resetData(XmlFileStorage.loadDataFromSaveFile(file));
        // Update the UI
        fillInnerParts();
    }
}
----

[source, java]
----
private void handleSaveAs() throws IOException {
    // Set extension filter
    FileChooser.ExtensionFilter extFilter = new FileChooser.ExtensionFilter(
            "XML files (*.xml)", "*.xml");
    fileChooser.getExtensionFilters().add(extFilter);

    // Show save file dialog
    File file = fileChooser.showSaveDialog(primaryStage);

    if (file != null) {
        // Make sure it has the correct extension
        if (!file.getPath().endsWith(".xml")) {
            file = new File(file.getPath() + ".xml");
        }
        // Change file path to the new save file
        storage.changeFilePath(file.getPath(), prefs);
        // Save the address book data and the user preferences
        storage.saveAddressBook(model.getAddressBook());
        storage.saveUserPrefs(prefs);
        // Update the UI
        fillInnerParts();
    }
}
----

Both `handleOpen` and `handleSaveAs` will create a new `FileChooser` extension filter that only allows the pop-up window to save files and load files in the .xml format.

Upon successfully selecting a file to load or a location to save as in the pop-up window, both methods will call `changefilepath` in `Storage` to the selected file path.

Finally, both commands diverge as `handleOpen` will call `resetData` to reset the data using the new save file, while `handleSaveAs` will call `saveAddressBook` and `saveUserPrefs` to save the data. Both methods will finally call `fillInnerParts()` to refresh the data displayed on the UI.

This process is illustrated using the sequence diagram below:

image::OpenSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.8.1 : Sequence Diagram for Opening a save file_

**Aspect:** How does `OpenCommand` and `SaveAsCommand` determine the file location to save or load the save file from +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Open a `FileChooser` window, allowing the user to move through their file directory to acquire their save location and to select the name of the save file. +
**Pros:** User friendly, many other applications function similarly when saving and loading. Easier to implement and use as part of the dropdown menu in the User Interface. +
**Cons:** Not entirely command line based.  +

**Alternative 2:** Input the file directory and file name to save or load from as part of the command. +
**Pros:** Entirely command line based, may be more preferable for users who prefer using the command line. +
**Cons:** Requires more complex code. Command must check if the file location to save or load from is valid, and that there is a valid file of that name.

// end::opensaveas[]

// tag::adddeletetag[]
=== Add/Delete Tag mechanism

The add/delete tag mechanism is facilitated by `personArrayList`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports add/delete
tag for all persons in the address book. This command will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

The add/delete tag command are executed by `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` are parsed through `AddTagCommandParser` and `DeleteTagCommandParser`.
It is different from `edit [INDEX] [TAG]` since it allows the user to perform the addition and deletion of tags for multiple people at once.
If the user wants to add the `t/friends` tag for the first 3 persons in the address book, the `AddTagCommand` (`addtag 1 2 3 t/friends`) will be executed.
The same operation will happen for `deletetag` command.

The `AddTagCommand` goes through all the persons in the address book and add tag to the persons with specific index. The `DeleteTagCommand` works
in a similar way.

The example of how `AddTagCommand` is working:
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Adds a tag to the persons in the list from the address book.
 */
public class AddTagCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    /**
         * Check whether the index within the range then checks whether the specific persons have the tag.
         * If not, add the tag to the person that doesn't have the given tag.
         */
        @Override
        public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {

            for (Index targetIndex : targetIndexes) {
                // check whether the index within the range
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < targetIndexes.size(); i++) {
                // check whether all persons have the given tag
            }
            // throw exception for duplicated tag
            return new CommandResult();
        }
----

Suppose the user enter the `addtag 1 2 t/friends` command. The following sequence diagram shows how the add tag command works:

image::AddTagSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.8.1 : Add Tag Sequence Diagram for Logic_ +
The `deletetag` command works the same as `addtag` command with different name only.

[NOTE]
If the input index does not exist, the `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` will throw an exception. +
If the tag to be deleted does not exist, the `DeleteTagCommand` will throw an exception. +
If the tag to be added exists in every target person in the address book, the `AddTagCommand` will throw an exception.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of the `addtag` and `deletetag` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** implement the methods in `ModelManager` +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. `ModelManager` includes all the methods and variables. +
**Cons:** Must modify `Model` also to fit the `ModelManager`. Beginner may have difficulty to understand the different functions in Model component+

**Alternative 2:** Implement the `addtag` and `deletetag` in `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` respectively. +
**Pros:** Easier to understand. +
**Cons:** Repetitive code. Additional overload constructor needs to be implement. The `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` will have to update the person list.
This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

---
**Aspect:** Implementation of the `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommand` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** create new command `addtag` and `deletetag` +
**Pros:** Less modification of existing command and parser +
**Cons:** Users have to learn how to use the additional commands +

**Alternative 2:** Modify the existing `add` and `delete` command +
**Pros:** Users could use the same commands to achieve different purpose +
**Cons:** Additional override the constructor for the existing command. It might not be easy for the beginner.
// end::adddeletetag[]

// tag::findtag[]

=== Find Tag mechanism

The find tag mechanism is facilitated by an ArrayList of Tags, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports finding persons by their tags in the address book.
This command will not inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

The `findtag` command is executed by `FindTagCommand` and is parsed through `FindTagCommandParser`.
After parsing through `FindTagCommandParser`, it does not goes to the `FindTagCommand` straightly. The list of tags input will be processed by `NameContainsTagsPredicate` first.
It is similar to the `find` command since find persons through their names and find persons through their tags are quite similar.

Please take not that although `FindTagCommand` is similar to `FindCommand`, there are still some differences.
`FindTagCommand` provides exclusive finding whereas `FindCommand` does not. It is achieved in the `NameContainsTagsPredicate`.

This is the example of how `NameContainsTagsPredicate` is working:
Firstly, it will convert a Set of Tag to String.

[source,java]
----
private String convertTagToString(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        Set<Tag> personTags = person.getTags();
        StringBuilder allTagNames = new StringBuilder();
        for (Tag tag : personTags) {
            allTagNames.append(tag.getTagName());
            allTagNames.append(" ");
        }
        return allTagNames.toString().trim();
    }
----
After having a list of string, it will then split strings into two ArrayList. One is for the tags we are looking for and another one
is for the tags to be excluded.

[source,java]
----
/**
     * Update the wantedTag and unwantedTag list
     * @param wantedTag list of tags to be searched
     * @param unwantedTag list of tags to not be searched
     */
    private void updateWantedTagUnwantedTag(List<String> wantedTag, List<String> unwantedTag) {
        for (String everyTag : tags) {
            if (!everyTag.startsWith("/not")) {
                wantedTag.add(everyTag);
            } else {
                unwantedTag.add(everyTag.substring(4));
            }
        }
    }
----

Lastly, it will return the result according to the user input. +
Suppose the user enter `findtag friends` command. The following sequence diagram shows how the find tag command works:

image::FindTagSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.9.1 : Find Tag Sequence Diagram for Logic_ +

[NOTE]
If the input index tags do not exist, the `FindTagCommand` will give a empty list.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of the `findtag` +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** implement a new command `findtag` +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. `findtag` command will be similar to the `find` command. +
**Cons:** Must create `NameContainsTagsPredicate` in model. It does not fully utilize the existing `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`. +

**Alternative 2:** Implement the `findtag` in `FindCommand`. +
**Pros:** Easier for user. They do not have to memorize some many commands. +
**Cons:** The existing `FindCommand` will not only response for finding persons through names only. This Violates Single Responsibility Principle
and Separation of Concerns as FindCommand now needs to do two different things.
// end::findtag[]

=== Favourite/Unfavourite Person mechanism
To favourite a person is achieved by `FavouriteCommand`. It basically changes the value of the `Favourite` field of a `Person`. The `Favourite` class has two status indicators: one is a boolean value and the other is a String. The boolean one is used in the constructor while the String one is for UI and output purposes.

In this sense, `Favourite` class needs to be created to store the favourite status of a contact. As `AddCommand` does not involve `Favourite`, the default `Favourite` status for every newly added `Person` is false.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `FavouriteCommand` is processed:

image::FavouriteSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
