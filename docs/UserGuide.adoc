== Overview

Address++ is an address book application that can store contacts, as well as maintain a list of ongoing tasks. You can use the various commands in Address++ to maintain, create, and delete your contacts, or tasks. +
Address++ is targeted at NUS students, such as those working on projects or assignments.

== About

After reading this user guide, you should be more familiar with how Address++ can be used to maintain your contacts and tasks. +
No technical knowledge is required when running the application, although basic knowledge of installation is required to install the prerequisite libraries for Address++ (Java). +

== Getting Started

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address++.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`help`*: opens this page in a new window
* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 r/This remark is a stub` :
adds a contact named `John Doe` to Address++.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder. The Open command kbd:[CTRL]+O` can also be used instead of manually overwriting the file if you wish to keep the original data file or store the new data file in a seperate location.
