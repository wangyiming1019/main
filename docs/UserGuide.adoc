//tag::introduction[]
Address++ is an application that keeps track of your contacts and your daily to-dos for you. It is targeted
at students who work on projects or assignments frequently, but it can also be used for other purposes.

== About

After reading this user guide, you should be more familiar with how Address++ can be used to maintain your contacts and tasks. +

No technical knowledge is required when running the application, although basic knowledge of installation is required to install the prerequisite libraries for Address++ (Java). +
//end::introduction[]

== Getting Started

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address++.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="800"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`help`*: opens this page in a new window
* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 r/This remark is a stub` :
adds a contact named `John Doe` to Address++.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

//tag::fontsize[]
=== Changing Font Sizes

Are the font sizes too small or too big? Address++ allows you to change your font sizes at will. Here are three
ways of changing the font sizes:
****
**Option 1: Menu Font Size Buttons and Keyboard Shortcuts**

image::FontSizeUI.png[width="540"]

* *Increase Size:* kbd:[CTRL] + kbd:[W] (kbd:[CMD] + kbd:[W] on MacOS)
* *Decrease Size:* kbd:[CTRL] + kbd:[E] (kbd:[CMD] + kbd:[E] on MacOS)
* *Reset Size:* kbd:[CTRL] + kbd:[R] (kbd:[CMD] + kbd:[R] on MacOS)
****

****
**Option 3: Handtype command into CLI**:

image::FontSizeCLI.png[width="540"]

* Increase Size Command: `fontsize increase`
* Decrease Size Command: `fs decrease`
* Reset Size Command: `fontsize reset`
* `fontsize` can be replaced with `fs` for faster input. +
****
//end::fontsize[]
=== Viewing help : `help`
If you have trouble figuring out how to do something, or would like to find out about more features, you can click
on the **help** menu button. You can also enter the command `help` to access the help window.

=== Adding a person: `add`

You can use the `add` command to add new people to your address book.

[NOTE]
`add` can be replaced by `a` for faster input.

Format: `add n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/REMARK] [v/AVATAR] [t/TAG]...` +

****
**Things To Note** +

=== Adding a tag to persons : `add tag/` (Since V1.2)

You can use the `add tag/` command to add tag for multiple persons in the address book. For example, you may wish to add the tag `friends` to the first two persons in the address book. +
[NOTE]
`add tag/` can be replaced by `a tag/` for faster input. +

Format: `add tag/ INDEX... t/[TAG]` +


****
**Things To Note**

* You can add the tag of the person at the specific `INDEX`. +
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing. +
* The index you key in *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ... +
* If you don not key in any indexes, `add tag/` will add the tag to all contacts in the address book.
****

**Example Scenarios:**
****
**Example Scenario 1:** +
Suppose you want to add tag `friends` to the 1st and 2nd persons in the address book. You can use `list` to show all the contacts in the address book first,
then use the `addtag` command to achieve it.

>> `list` +

****
// end::edittask[]
// tag::edittag[]
=== Renaming existing tags : `edit tag/` (Since v1.2)

You can use `edit tag/` to rename one existing tag. For example, you may wish to promote all existing "acquaintances" into "friends", or change all "CS2103" project mates to "CS2101" project mates instead. +
[NOTE]

* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* You can only provide `true` or `false` as inputs after each prefix.
* If you choose to input `false`, you will set the privacy of that field for that person to be public. The data in that field will be visible in the UI.
* If you choose to input `true`, you will set the privacy of that field for that person to be private. The data in that field cannot be modified and will not be visible in the UI.
* Fields that do not originally contain any data will still remain empty after changing their privacy.
* If you do not add a prefix for the field in the command, that field will keep its original privacy setting.
****

**Example Scenarios:**:
****
**Example Scenario 1** +
You are meeting some new groupmates for your upcoming project and you are not too comfortable with exposing your family's particulars. +
You decide to hide your family's phone number, email and home address by setting them to private. +
>> `changeprivacy 1 p/true e/true a/true`
****
// end::changeprivacy[]

// tag::privacylevel[]
=== Changing the Privacy Level of the address book : `privacylevel`(Since V1.5)

Changing a person's privacy just to reveal their data or to make a person fully confidential may be time-consuming. If you would like to view all the data hidden by private fields easily, or completely hide a person with private fields, you can use this command to change the Privacy Level of the address book. +
At level 1, all data, regardless of whether they are set to be private or public, can be viewed. +
At level 2, private fields will have their data hidden by a string, such as `<Private Phone>`. +
At level 3, any person containing at least one private field will be completely hidden in the address book. +
[NOTE]
`privacylevel` can be replaced by `pl` for faster input. +

Format: `privacylevel LEVEL`

****
* Address++ always launches in privacy level 2.
* The `LEVEL` that you input can only contain the values 1, 2, or 3.
* This does not change the actual privacy setting of each field, thus, changing the privacy level to 1 does not make any of the private fields public.
** Thus, even if you have set the address book to be privacy level 1, you cannot edit a field that is set as private without setting it back to public.
** Similarly, since a person is completely hidden in privacy level 3, you will have to set the privacy level back to 2 or 1 to be able to modify that person.
****

**Example Scenarios:**:
****
**Example Scenario 1** +
You have an address book full of various contacts with private fields, however, now you need to access the email addresses of all your contacts to ask them for help in your upcoming survey. +
You decide to use the privacylevel command to reveal all you contacts' hidden data.
>> `privacylevel 1`

**Example Scenario 2** +
You wish to completely hide some of your confidential contacts from view, but your address book is too large, and you do not want to have to individually set every field for every confidential person to be private. +
Using the privacylevel command, you set each contact with any private field to be hidden in the address book. +
>> `privacylevel 3`

****
// end::privacylevel[]

// tag::favourite[]

=== Favouriting persons : `favourite` (since V1.3)

You can use `favourite` command to make persons in the address book become your favourite contacts. For example, you may wish to set your girlfriend as your favourite contact. You will see a heart png next to your girlfriend's name
once you successfully set her as your favourite contact. +
[NOTE]
`favourite` can be replaced by `fav` for faster input. +

Format: `favourite INDEX [MORE INDEX]` +

****
**Things To Note**

* You can set a person to be the favourite person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index you key in *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You will see a heart shape next to your favourite persons.
****

**Examples Scenario:** +
****
**Example Scenario 1:** +
Suppose you want to set the 2nd person in the address book to be your favourite contact. You should `list` all the persons first, then use `favourite` command to achieve it.

>> `list` +
>> `favourite 2` +
****

****
**Example Scenario 2:** +
Suppose you have `Betsy Brandt, Betsy Devos and Betsy Ross` in your address book. You want to set `Betsy Brandt` as your favourite contact.
Instead of `listing` all the contacts, you can `find` all the `Besty` first, then `favourite` her.

>> `find Betsy` +
>> `favourite 1` +

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Both the name and the description will be searched
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* *You must include at least 1 search keyword*, in order to filter the results by their priority, and whether or not it is completed.
* The `PRIORITY` must be an integer from 1 to 5, inclusive. If the priority search is included, all tasks that have a priority at least that of the specified priority will matced.
