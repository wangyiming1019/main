//tag::introduction[]
Address++ is an application that keeps track of your contacts and your daily to-dos for you. It is targeted
at students who work on projects or assignments frequently, but it can also be used for other purposes.

== About

After reading this user guide, you should be more familiar with how Address++ can be used to maintain your contacts and tasks. +
No technical knowledge is required when running the application, although basic knowledge of installation is required to install the prerequisite libraries for Address++ (Java). +
//end::introduction[]

== Getting Started

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address++.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="800"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`help`*: opens this page in a new window
* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 r/This remark is a stub` :
adds a contact named `John Doe` to Address++.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Adding a person: `add`

You can use the `add` command to add new people to your address book

[NOTE]
`add` can be replaced by `a` for faster input.

Format: `add n/NAME p/[PHONE_NUMBER] e/[EMAIL] a/[ADDRESS] r/[REMARK] v/[AVATAR] [t/TAG]...` +

****
**Things To Note** +
* A person can have any number of tags (including 0) +
* The `EMAIL` should be in the format address@email.domain +

**Example Scenario 1** +
Suppose you wanted to add your new friend John Doe. You could type the following command to add his details:

`add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/11-11-1995 r/Likes panda bears
v/https://helloworld/image.png`
****
****
**Example Scenario 2** +
Now suppose you have another friend named Ima Hidearu, who does not provide you with all the contact information that
you need. You can choose to omit these fields by typing in the command:

`add n/Ima Hidearu a/ e/ p/ r/ v/ t/secretive`

****
****
**Example Scenario 3** +
Sometimes, you may wish to keep some fields private (i.e. not reveal them in the application). You can use the private
option while typing in your command:

`add pn/Neville Shorttop pp/46492787 pe/nevilleS@gmail.com pa/Gryphon Gate pr/A true hero` +

* Do note that you do not have to set all fields as private, and you can choose which specific fields you want to set as private.
****
//end::avatar[]

//end::addprivacy[]

[NOTE]
As of version 1.5rc, the avatar field supports only URLs sourced online. References to local files may not work.
//tag::addtask[]
=== Adding a task: `add task`

You can use the `add task` command to add new tasks to your address book. This allows you to keep track of your
assignments and project objectives.

Format: `add task n/NAME d/[DESCRIPTION] by/[DEADLINE] p/[PRIORITY]` +

[NOTE]
`add` can be replaced by `a` for faster input.

****
**Things To Note** +

* A task priority must be a positive integer from 1 to 5 inclusive, with 5 being the highest priority +
* Newly added tasks are marked as incomplete by default.
****

**Examples**:
****
**Example Scenario 1** +
You are assigned the task of updating the documentation for a software engineering project. You decide to add this
task into the Address++ application.

****
****
**Example Scenario 2** +
You realize that you have run out of pencils. You decide to add a task into Address++ to remind you to get some
new ones later.
`add task n/Buy new pencil p/2`
****
// end::addtask[]

// tag::addtag[]

=== Adding a tag to persons : `addtag` (Since V1.2)

You can use the `addtag` command to add tag for multiple persons in the address book. For example, you may wish to add tag `friends` to the first two persons in the address book. +
`addtag` can be replaced by `atag` for faster input. +
Format: `addtag INDEX... t/[TAG]` +


****
**Things To Note**

* You can add the tag of the person at the specific `INDEX`. +
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing. +
* The index you key in *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ... +
* If you don not key in any indexes, addtag will add the tag to all contacts in the address book.
****

**Examples Scenarios:**
****
**Example Scenario 1:** +
Suppose you want to add tag `friends` to the 1st and 2nd persons in the address book, you can use `list` to show all the contacts in the address book first,
then use the `addtag` command to achieve it.

`list` +
`addtag 1 2 t/friends` +
****

****
**Example Scenario 2:** +
Suppose you want to add a common tag to all the persons in the address book. You can type in the following command.

`list` +
`addtag t/acquaintance` +
****
// end::addtag[]

=== Listing all persons : `list`

Need a quick overview of what needs to be done? You can use the `list` command to quickly show all your contacts, or tasks, in the address book. +
Format: `list` +

Instead of typing out `list` every time, you can alternatively use `l` to shorten the command.

// tag::editprivacy[]
=== Editing a person : `edit`

You can use the `edit` command to quickly fix mistakes in your entries, or add/remove details in your contacts. You may wish to edit your contacts when they change their phone numbers, for example. +
`edit` can be replaced by `e` for faster input. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/REMARK] [v/AVATAR] [t/TAG]...` +

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the last listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You must provide at least one field to edit for each command.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed. This means that you cannot cumulatively add tags using multiple `edit` commands.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* A private field will not be modified by the Edit command.
* An Edit command containing only private fields will result in a error message.
* An Edit command with both private and public fields will only modify the public fields.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
* `edit 1 p/` +
Removes the phone number of the 1st person.

Adding `task` after `edit` will allow you to edit task details instead. You may wish to edit your task deadlines, for example, when your project schedule changes, or your task priorities, when a task becomes more urgent. +
Format: `edit task INDEX [n/NAME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [by/DEADLINE] [p/PRIORITY]` +

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the last listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

`edittag` can be replaced by `et` for faster input. +

Format: `edittag TAGTOBERENAMED NEWTAGNAME` +

****
* The two tag names must be different.
* This command will not work if none of your contacts have a tag with the `TAGTOBERENAMED` value.
****

Examples:

* `edittag friends enemies` +
Changes the tag called `friends` to one called `enemies` instead. All existing contacts with a `friends` tag will now have an `enemies` tag instead.
// end::edittag[]

// tag::changeprivacy[]
=== Changing the Privacy of a person's details : `changeprivacy`(Since V1.3)

You can use the `changeprivacy` command to set the privacy settings for each field of an existing `Person` in the address book, which allows you to choose specifically what information will be displayed. +

* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* You can only provide `true` or `false` as inputs after each prefix.
* If you choose to input `false`, you will set the privacy of that field for that person to be public. The data in that field will be visible in the UI.
* If you choose to input `true`, you will set the privacy of that field for that person to be private. The data in that field cannot be modified and will not be visible in the UI.
* Fields that do not originally contain any data will still remain empty after changing their privacy.
* If you do not add a prefix for the field in the command, that field will keep its original privacy setting.
****

Examples:

* `changeprivacy 1 p/false e/true` +
Sets the phone number of the 1st person to be public and their email address to be private. The 1st person's phone number will be displayed, if available, while their email address will be hidden in the UI.

// end::showfavourite[]

=== Locating persons by name : `find`

You can use the `find` command to quickly filter out contacts, or tasks who match your criteria. For example, you may wish to find all the tasks marked with the highest priority, or all your contacts who have a certain family name. +
`find` can be replaced by `f` for faster input. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` +

Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`

Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

Adding `task` after `find` will allow you to sieve through your tasks, instead of your contacts. +
In addition to searching the name and description of tasks, you can also opt to filter your tasks by their priority. Simply include `p/PRIORITY` after all your other criteria to do so. +
You can also opt to find all tasks that are either complete or incomplete by including an optional `done/ISTASKDONE` in the command.
All tasks with a priority higher than or equal to the value provided will be shown. +
Format: `find task KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] [p/PRIORITY] [done/ISTASKDONE]` +

****
*Important note on `find` criteria*

`open` can be replaced by `o` for faster input. +
Format `open`
// end::open[]

// tag::saveas[]
=== Saving the data as a new save file : `save`
If you would like to save a copy of your data in a separate location or with a different name, the `save` command will allow you to do just that. +
You can choose what to name your save file and where to save it from the pop up window that appears upon executing this command. +

There is no need for you to save manually.

If you want to change the location of the save file, you can use the `save` command, click on `File -> Save As` or use the keyboard shortcut kbd:[CTRL]+kbd:[S] and select the new location and file name for the save file in the pop-up window.

If you want to open a different save file, you can use the `open` command, click on `File -> Open` or use the keyboard shortcut kbd:[CTRL]+kbd:[O] and select the new save file to use from the pop-up window.

// end::opensaveas[]
=== Using the browser

If you click on a box containing a contact, an internet browser on the right side of the window.
****
* Performing a left click will allow you to perform a search on Google for the name of the contact, and is equivalent to doing a `select` on that oerson.
* If a person's name or address is set to private, the browser will not perform a search if you click on their box.
* Right clicking on the browser will allow you to go to the previous or next page, as well as reload the page.
****

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder. The Open command kbd:[CTRL]+kbd:[O] can also be used instead of manually overwriting the file if you wish to keep the original data file or store the new data file in a seperate location.
