*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W09-B2/main/blob/master/collated/main/charlesgoh.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W09-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/charlesgoh.md[Test code]]

=== Password Protection Commands `lock` `unlock` `changepassword`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=password]

#End of Extract#
---

==== Justification

Many users have security related concerns. In order to slow malicious users from causing
damage to users' Address++ application, the password protection suite of commands were
created.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=password]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Sort Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#
---

==== Justification

As more contacts and tasks are added to the application, the lists may get long and disorganized. The Sort Command
allows users to sort both contacts and tasks by key fields. Examples include sorting contacts by name and
sorting contacts by deadlines.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Backup Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#
---

==== Justification

Users are able to back up their data before making any changes so that in the event of an
emergency (e.g. clearing all data and then closing afterwards), the old save data can be restored.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Font Size Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=fontsize]

#End of Extract#
---

==== Justification

Different monitors render the application differently. On some monitors, the words may appear to be too small. The font size
commands and buttons allow users to increase/decrease/reset the font sizes at any time when using the application.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=fontsize]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Avatar and Remark Fields

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=avatar]

#End of Extract#
---

==== Justification

Avatars and remarks help users to identify different contacts. It was also implemented with the intention of making the application
more user friendly.

==== Implementation for Avatar Field
